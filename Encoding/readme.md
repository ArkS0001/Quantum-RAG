Basis and Amplitude Encodings are foundational methods; while basis encoding is straightforward, amplitude encoding offers qubit efficiency but at the cost of complex state preparation.
Phase/Angle Encoding maps classical information into rotations or phase shifts, leveraging the Bloch sphere’s geometric interpretation.
Q‑Sample Encoding is tailored for quantum machine learning tasks where each classical sample must be represented with high fidelity.
QuAM not only serves as an encoding method but also functions as an associative memory, enabling retrieval based on pattern similarity—a key benefit for tasks like pattern recognition.
Repeated Amplitude Encoding introduces redundancy to boost resilience against quantum noise, an essential feature for practical implementations on current quantum hardware.
